# Assignment Transient Groundwater Flow (IHE Hydrology Feb. 2024)

Prof. dr.ir. T.N.Olsthoorn

Continuous registration of the pressure n piezometers placed in a coastal dune area, after sbutracting the barometer pressure and converting to head, clearly show the tide in the aquifer. The aquifer consists of sand with a hydraulic conductivity of around 25 m/d. Given the groundwater reaction:

Proof that the aquifer is either (semi)confined or unconfined.

Compute th damping charcteristic of the sea tide (which has a cycle time of 12h20min (12:20)), in the groundwater and estimate at what distance from the piezometer nearest to the coast the sea can be considered in direct contact with the aquifer such as to use this distance as a boundary in your groundwater model or further analysis.

To what distance from the see could you reasonable measure the tide (observe it in you continuous registration?

[tide at HVH]

[tide in grw]

What is the delay of the tide to expect at the different piezometers?

If pumping tests have been shown that the transmissivity of the aquifer is around 1250 m/d, what could you conclude about the storage coefficient of this aquifer?

On top of the tide visible in the graph, there is another tide, with a cycle time of 28 days. What would be the characteristic lenght of the cycle in the subsuface for this lower graph and, therefore, the degree of damping compared to the tide with 12:20 cycle time?

[graph after subtracting barometer]

In the second picture there is a graph of the registered absolute pressure after the barometer was subtracted and the head was computed. Although there is no correlation between the head in the shallow aquifer and the barometer pressure, there surely is between that in the second piezometer and the baromtric pressure, even after the barometric pressure has been subtracted from the origional data.


What can you conclude from this correlation.
And how large would you estimate the barometric efficiency?

How large an error can you make in deriving the head from absolute pressure registrations if you con't subtract the barometric pressure? see barometric graph.

Along the sandy benches of a lake one observes a wet zone of several decimeters thickness just above the water on top of which a white band of a few cm thickness is visible.

Explain the phenomenon and what can be concluded from it.
If the measured wet zone is 30 cm thick, what can you conclude with respect to the size of the largest pores of the sand?
