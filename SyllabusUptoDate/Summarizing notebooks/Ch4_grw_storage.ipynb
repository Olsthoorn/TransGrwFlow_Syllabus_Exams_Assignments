    "In this course we'll only deal with reversible groundwater storage. Non-reversible forms like liquifaction, subsidence and to a lesser extent (over)extracting fresh water from aquifers that also contain salt water, are no longer regarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basis forms of reversible storage of groundwater, storage by filling and emptying of pores above the water table and compressing and decompressing water and the grain matrix throughout the full thickness of the aquifer. In a water table aquifer, both type of storage are active at the same time, however the storage by filling and emptying of pores is much more, usually  around 50 or  more time larger than the elastic storage. Therefore, in water table aquifers, we normally neglect the elastic storage component, but in reality and in a good numerical model both are present and act simultaneously."

    "\n",
    "You can think of the specific yield as the amount of water that freely drips from a bag of 1 m3 of saturated sand of soil when it's let to drip out freely by gravity. Clearly, not all water will drip out and therefore, specific yield is much smaller than the porosity of that sand. The the fraction of water still remaining is called specific retention. Specific retention plus specific yield make up the total  porosity of the sand or soil. In dry periods with deep water tables, so that capillary rise is negligible, plants suck from this water. But even after plants have sucked all the water from the soil to the extent that they start wilting, there is still a small fraction of water left in the sand. The specific retention minus the fraction of water still present after plants reached their wilting point, about equivalent a suction of 160 m of water , is called field capacity, which is the water available to plants after the water dripped out freely by gravity from the saturated sand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of cohesion between water and the sand or soil particles, water is sucked into dry pores above the water table. Notice, that the water table is by definition the level at which the pressure of teh water is equal to that of the atmosphere. Hence, it is the water level in a hole dug to below the water table. However, in the pores water rises to above that water table by cohesion. A layer of some thickness above the water table is even fully saturated. This layer is called the capillary fringe. And although the water in the capillary fringe flows exactly like the water below it, we neglect the thickness of the capillary fringe when we define the wetted thickness of our water table aquifer. The fringe is generally one to a few decimeters thick. Above the capillary fringe the sand or soil will only be partly saturated and, therefore also partly filled with air. The higher above the top of the capillary fringe, the lower the saturation, at least without recharge.\n",

Fine textured soils tend  to have a higher total porosity as there is less the gravity force per grain is less to overcome the friction with adjacent particles during natural sedimentation, so the tend to reach a lower compaction in nature than do  coarser textured soils that have similar grain shapes. Of course, actual soils may differ from this general pattern, because there may be smaller particles filling the space between coarser ones, thus causing a lower total porosity, or the sediment may have been compressed (consolidated) by for geological processes or pores may have been particle filled by precipitation of minerals.\n",

Lowering or rising the water table than misses the part of the profile extending above ground surface. This implies that the specific yield declines when the water table approaches ground surface, and that then a small rain shower may suddenly fill the entire soil to ground surface.\n",

    "The theory given above is also valid for semi-confined aquifers.However, as soon as the barometer pressure say increase by $\\Delta p_a$, the full $\\Delta p_a$ on the water aquifer will be felt in the water on top of the first aquitard, where we then have $\\Delta \\sigma_w \\approx \\Delta p_a$. However, below this aquitard the water pressure increases by only $\\Delta \\sigma_w = L_E\\Delta p_a$. A head difference is thus created across the aquitard, so that water starts leaking through the aquitard which will deminish this head difference over time. It well then depend on the rate of change of the barometer pressure compared to the rate of change of pressure in the aquier due to leakage, to what extent and for how long the barometer pressure changes can be seen in the time series of the registered water pressures. Is is possible to make an analysis of that as well, but this is considered beyond the current subject."
